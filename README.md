# Keyword Search Tool
# A simple Python script to search keywords on the dark web and hacker forums. The script that uses the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to perform a keyword search on a specific website:

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# define the website url and keyword to search for
url = 'https://example.com'
keyword = 'python'

# make a GET request to the website
response = requests.get(url)

# parse the HTML response with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# use the find_all method to find all instances of the keyword
instances = soup.find_all(text=lambda text: text and keyword in text)

# print out the instances of the keyword
for instance in instances:
    print(instance)  
```

# To perform a keyword search across multiple websites, you can loop through a list of URLs and modify the script to work for each URL

```
# define a list of website urls and the keyword to search for
urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://example2.com']
keyword = 'python'

# loop through each website url
for url in urls:
    # make a GET request to the website
    response = requests.get(url)

    # parse the HTML response with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # use the find_all method to find all instances of the keyword
    instances = soup.find_all(text=lambda text: text and keyword in text)

    # print out the instances of the keyword for each website
    for instance in instances:
        print(f"{url}: {instance}")       
 ```
 
 # Note that this is just a basic example script and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, be respectful of websitesâ€™ terms of service and avoid scraping websites without their permission.
